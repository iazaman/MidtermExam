Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A.A programming language is a type of language used to communicate instructions to a computer. They come in the form of
code or source code to complete a specific task or achieve a desired outcome. Programming language can be used to create
all kinds of software.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. JDK or Java Development Kit is used to develop Java applications. It contains a set of tools, libraries, and runtime
environments that are necessary to develop and run Java applications. The main components of JDK are;
    -Java compiler: Java compiler is used compile Java source code into bytecode that can be executed on any platform that
the Java Virtual Machine installed.
    -Java Virtual Machine: Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that runs Java bytecode.  It is responsible for
interpreting bytecode and executing it on the computer.
    -Java Runtime Environment: Java Runtime Environment provides the runtime environment for Java applications. It includes
Java Virtual Machine and class libraries that are required to to run Java programs.
    -Java API Documentation:The Java API Documentation provides detailed information about Java Application Programming
Interface(API). It includes information about the classes, methods and variables that are in Java.
    -Java Development Tools:  Java Development Tools are a set of tools that are used to develop Java applications. They
include Eclipse & IntelliJ IDE, which provides an integrated development environment for Java programming.
    -JavaFX: JavaFX is a set of graphics and media APIs that are used to develop rich client applications. It includes
the support for 2D and 3D graphics, audio and video playback and animation.





What is IDE?
A. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software application that provides comprehensive tools and
features for software development. An IDE typically includes a code editor, a debugger, a compiler, and other tools that
help developers write, test and debug software more efficiently.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. The two most commonly used IDEs that support Java in the market are Eclipse & IntelliJ. Other IDEs in the market
include: NetBeans,JDeveloper & BlueJ.



Explain the entire java life cycle.
  - Java life cycle typically includes the following phases:
    1)Requirement Gathering:- in this phase the project requirements are identified and documented.
    2)Analysis and Design:- in this phase, the system architecture and design are developed based on the requirements
 gathered in the previous phase.
    3)Implementation:- in this phase, the actual development of the Java application takes place. Developers write code
 according to design specifications.
    4)Testing:- in this phase, the Java application is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements specified in the
 earlier phases. This includes unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
    5)Deployment:- in this phase, the Java application is deployed in the production environment. This includes configuring
 the application servers, databases and other required infrastructure.
    6)Maintenance:- in this final phase, Java application is maintained and updated over its life cycle. This includes
 fixing bugs, adding new features, and addressing any issues that arise during operation.
what is class?
    -A class is a blueprint that defines the characteristics and behavior of an object. A class encapsulates data and the
operations that can be performed on that data ,providing a structured way to represent and manipulate complex systems.
What is object?
    -An object is an instance of a class, each object is created from a class blueprint and contains its own unique state
and identity.
What is the entry point of an application?
    -The entry point of an application is the main method. The main method is a special method that serves as the
    starting point for the execution of the Java program.
Why main is static?
    -The main method is static because it needs to be invoked by the Java Virtual Machine without creating an instance
    of the class. When JVM starts up the program, it needs to call the main method before any objects of the class are
    created.
Which class is the superclass of all classes?
    -The 'object' class is the superclass of all classes. Every class in Java is either a direct or indirect subclass of
    this class.
What is difference between path and classpath variables?
    - The Path variable is a system-wide environment variable that specifies a list of directories in which the
    operating system will search for executable files. The Classpath variables is a specific Java environment variable
    that specifies a list of directories and/or JAR files in which the JVM will search for class files.
What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
    -The difference between an Interface and Abstract class is that an interface a completely abstract type that defines
    a set of method signatures, while an abstract class can contain both abstract and non-abstract methods and may also
    contain variables, constructors and other features of a Java class.
Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
    - You cannot create objects from an interface or an abstract class directly in Java because they are both abstract
    types that cannot be be instantiated. You can create objects of concrete classes that implement the interface or
    extend the abstract class.
what is Access Specifier?
    -Access specifier is a keyword that is used to determine the accessibility of a class, method or variable. The types
    access specifier include: public, private, protected & default.
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
    -OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. It contains concepts based on the concept of 'objects' which contain
    code to interact with each other to perform tasks. The 4 OOPS features are:-
    1)Encapsulation:- This concept is the hiding of data. It is achieved by sing access modifiers like private, public,
    protected and default, and by providing methods to access and modify the data.
    2)Inheritance:- This concept is of creating new classes by inheriting the properties and behaviors of existing
    classes. It uses the 'extends' keyword and allows a subclass to inherit methods and properties of its
    superclass.
    3)Polymorphism:- This is the concept of allowing a single variable, object or method to have different forms or
    behaviors depending on the context. It is achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
    4)Abstraction:-This is the concept of the complexity of an object and presenting only the essential features of the
    user. It is implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.
What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
    - A package is a way of organizing related classes and interfaces into a single unit of code. By default Java
    imports the java.lang package.
What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
    -API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of methods, protocols and tools that are using to
    build software applications. I have used the Java SE API which is the core Java API. It provides the basic
    functionality of the Java programming language.
Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
    -Java does not support the multiple inheritance of classes but it does support the multiple inheritance of
    interfaces. It does not support the multiple inheritance of classes because it can lead to issues such as name
    conflicts and ambiguity.
What is method overloading and when it happens?
    - Method overloading is a feature in Java that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name, but with
    different parameters.
Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
    -An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of
    instructions. To handle an exception we use try-catch block.
What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
    -Static keyword is used to create variables and methods that belong in a class rather than to a instance of a
    class. When used with methods, static keyword creates a class-level method than can be called without creating an
    object of a class.
What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
    -Final keyword is used to create constants or to indicate that a variable or method should not be changed after it
    is initialized.
What is final, finally and finalize?
    -Final is a keyword that is used to create a constant that cannot be changed. Finally is a keyword that is used in a
    try-catch-finally block to specify a block of code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown
    or caught. Finalize is a method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is destroyed.
What is a constructor ?
    -A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize an object of a class.
Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
    -Yes it is possible to have multiple constructors in a class. It is called constructor overloading.
If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
    -If we do not declare a constructor in a class, Java will provide a default constructor with an empty body.
What is "this" keyword in java ?
    -'This" is a keyword that refers to the current object instance.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
    -'Super' is a keyword that refers to the parent class of a subclass.
What is JVM stand for ?
    -JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
Is JVM platform independent?
    -Yes JVM is independent.
What version of java are you using?
    -I am using JDK 11.
What is JAR stand for ?
    -JAR stands for Java Archive.
What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
    -JDK is a software development kit that provides the tools needed to develop, test and debug Java
    applications. JVM is a runtime environment in which Java programs run.
What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
    -JRE is the environment in which Java programs run. It includes JVM and other  components needed to run Java
    applications. JVM is responsible for interpreting the compiled Java bytecode and executing the program.
What is compile time and run time?
    -Compile time is the time when the program is translated from source code to machine code by a compiler. Run
    time is the time when the program is executed by a computer.
What is heap?
    -Heap is a region of computer's memory that is used for dynamic memory allocation.
How java manage it's memory?
    -Java manages its memory through a process called automatic memory management, which is also known as garbage
    collection.
What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
    -String is a immutable class,which means that once String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
    StringBuffer is a mutable class which provides a thread-safe way to modify String. StringBuilder is also a
    mutable class that provides a faster, non-thread-safe way to modify a string.
What is Singleton class?
    -A singleton class is a design pattern in object oriented-programming that restricts the instantiation of a
    class to one object.
What is Serialization and Deserialization?
    - Serialization is the process of converting an object's state into sequence of bytes, which can then be
    written to a file, sent over to a network, or stored in a database. The opposite process, converting the sequence
    of bytes back into an object's state, is called deserialization.
when to use transient variable in java?
    -Transient variables can be used to mark an instance of a variable as not eligible for serialization.
Difference between while and do..while loop?
    -In while loop the condition is checked before the loop body is executed. In do-while loop the loop body
    condition will be checked at least once before execution and if it is false it then it won't be executed at
    all.

What is Enum?
    -An enum is a special data type used to define a set of predefined constant values.

What is Iterator?
    -An iterator an interface that provides a way to access elements of a collection one by one, and perform
    operations on them.
Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
    -An integer will take up more memory. An int is a primitive type that requires 4 bytes. An integer data
    type that wraps the 'int' primitive types and provides additional methods and functionality.
Why is String Immutable in Java?
    -Whenever any operation is performed on a string, a new string object is created instead of modifying the original
    string object. This is because the string object is cached in the String pool,and if the original object is
    modified, it can cause inconsistencies and errors in the parts of the program that are using the cached object.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
    -Constructor chaining refers to calling one constructor from another constructor of the same class or from its
    superclass.
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
    -The parallel garbage collector is faster than the serial garbage collector because it can use multiple threads to
    perform garbage collection. However the parallel garbage collection may use more CPU resources and may not be the
    best choice for applications that are running on machines with limited CPU resources.
What is JIT stands for?
    -JIT stands for Just In Time. It is a type of JVM compiler that compiles Java bytecode into native machine code at
    runtime or "just in time" basis.
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
    -Java heap space is a portion of the system memory that is allocated to the JVM for running Java applications. The
    garbage collector is responsible for freeing up memory that is no longer being used by the application.
Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
    -As a programmer you cannot guarantee the garbage collection process. The JVM controls the garbage collection
    process and it is non-deterministic in nature.
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
    -Some main differences between stack and heap are:
    1)Stack is used for storing primitive data types and object references while heap is used for storing objects.
What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
    -Reflection in Java is a feature that allows the examination and modification of the runtime behavior of an
    application. With reflection we can inspect a class, interface, object or method and obtain its properties, fields,
    methods,and annotations dynamically at runtime.
what is multithreading in java?
    -Multithreading refers to the capability of a program to execute multiple threads simultaneously.
What is the use of synchronization in Java?
    -Synchronization is used to control concurrent access to shared resources or critical sections of code to avoid data
    races or other problems that can arise when multiple threads try to access or modify the same data simultaneously.
What is Framework?
    -A framework is a pre-designed software of architecture that provides a set of reusable components or modules to
    develop applications or software systems.
What are the testing Framework available in java?
    -Some of the popular testing frameworks available in Java are: JUnit, testNG, Selenium & Cucumber.
Difference between jUnit and testNG?
    - testNG is more feature rich and provides better flexibility for testing. JUnit however is simpler to use is more
    suitable for smaller projects. testNG has a richer set of annotations for example. testNG provides for parallel
    execution of tests, which is not available in JUnit. testNG also provides better reporting capabilities compared
    to JUnit.
What are the dependencies for this project?
    -The dependency for this project is GitBash from which we are accessing our midterm project.
what is dependency injection in java?
    -Dependency injection is a design pattern used in object-oriented programming to enable objects to request
    dependencies from an external source rather than creating them themselves.
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
    -Static binding occurs for overloaded methods and constructors, while dynamic binding occurs for overridden methods.
